        <h1> The Story </h1>        
        <p> Elyssa and Joe met at Island Lake Summer Camp in the summer of 2012. Since then they have become real close.
        The problem is that Elyssa lives in New Jersey and Joe lives in Missouri. Taking time from work and school
        to go visit each other is a task in its self, but they try to make the best of breaks and holidays. They are two 
        people who love the outdoors and playing sports. Elyssa plays rugby for her college, while Joe plays soccer for his
        school. Both love to snowboard and really any new activity.</p>
